Exercism Exercises in C++

## Contributing Guide

Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md)

The most useful way to start contributing to this track is to review Pull Requests and/or some of the open track issues.
There are not many active contributors, so anyone reviewing PRs or Issues, even just to +1 someone elses opinion, is appreciated.

## Adding an exercise

Here is a list of things that need to be done to add an exercise to this track.

1. Add the exercise under the exercises/ directory.
2. Create your test suite based on the canonical tests in the [problem specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repo.
3. Create an example solution and name the files 'example.cpp' and 'example.h'.
4. Add the test to the list in the root CMakeLists.txt file.
5. Add the test to the config.json file. The [configlet](https://github.com/exercism/configlet) can help generate a unique UUID.
6. Use the [configlet](https://github.com/exercism/configlet) tool to generate the README for your exercise.
7. Try to match the formatting used in the other tests as closely as possible.

## Testing an exercise

The Exercism build system has two unusual constraints. First, example solutions
must be named `example.h` and `example.cpp`; this prevents Exercism from sending
these files to the student. Second, student solutions must be named `<exercise>.h`
and `<exercise>.cpp`, for example `anagram.h` and `anagram.cpp`.

The current CMake build system navigates this with an unusual approach: it copies
all example solutions from the `exercises/` tree to an alternate directory
(which is ignored by git), renames the solutions as if they were student exercises,
and runs a complete build in this new directory.

Maintainers can largely ignore the alternate exercise directory if they recopy
their example solution before running a build. Re-running CMake will recopy
all exercise files.

For example, a maintainer can copy, configure, compile, and test all exercises with:
```bash
cmake . && make
```

For an individual exercise, in this example `anagram`, the maintainer should edit:
```bash
exercises/anagram/example.h
exercises/anagram/example.cpp
```

Then copy, configure, compile, and test with:
```bash
cmake . && make test_anagram
```
